## Development

### Tools

We use the following tools for development:

- [QUnit](http://qunitjs.com/) for tests.
- [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org/download/) required to run grunt.
- [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started) for task management.

### Getting started

Install [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org/).  
Install globally grunt-cli using the following command:

    $ npm install -g grunt-cli

Browse to the project root directory and install the dev dependencies:

    $ npm install -d

To execute the build and tests run the following command in the root of the project:

    $ grunt

You should see a green message in the console:

    Done, without errors.

### Tests

You can also run the tests in the browser.  
Start a test server from the project root:

    $ grunt connect:tests

This will automatically open the test suite at http://127.0.0.1:10000 in the default browser, with livereload enabled.

_Note: we recommend cleaning all the browser cookies before running the tests, that can avoid false positive failures._

### Automatic build

You can build automatically after a file change using the following command:

    $ grunt watch
